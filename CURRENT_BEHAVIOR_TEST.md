// Test the current fallback behavior
// When you type "add" in the app, this is what should happen:

1. NLU tries all URLs and fails
2. Fallback creates this JSON:
   {
     "text": "add",
     "intent": {"name": "fallback"},
     "entities": [],
     "intent_ranking": []
   }

3. NLUTaskHandler processes it:
   - Intent is "fallback"
   - Goes to default case
   - Calls _handleFallbackTaskCreation("add", context)

4. Should return helpful message:
   "I can help you manage tasks! Try saying:
   • 'Add task to buy groceries'
   • 'Remind me to call John'
   • 'List my tasks'
   • 'Delete task 1'
   
   What would you like to do?"

// If this message isn't appearing, there might be an issue with the NLUTaskHandler file.
