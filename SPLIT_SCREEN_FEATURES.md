# Split-Screen Interface with Real-Time Task Management

## Overview
The app now features a revolutionary split-screen interface that combines task viewing and voice interaction in one seamless experience. This design allows users to see real-time updates as they manage tasks through voice commands or manual input.

## Features

### ðŸ”„ **Real-Time Updates**
- Tasks appear instantly in the top section when added via voice commands
- Task counter updates automatically as tasks are added/removed
- No need to refresh or navigate between screens

### ðŸŽ¤ **Voice-Powered Task Management**
Users can now perform complete task management through natural voice commands:

#### Adding Tasks
- *"Add task to buy groceries"*
- *"Remind me to call John"*
- *"Create a task to finish the project by Friday"*
- *"I need to schedule a doctor's appointment"*

#### Listing Tasks
- *"Show my tasks"*
- *"List all tasks"*
- *"What do I need to do?"*

#### Deleting Tasks
- *"Delete task 1"*
- *"Remove the grocery task"*
- *"Delete buy groceries"*

### ðŸ“± **Split-Screen Layout**

#### Top Half - Task List
- **Header**: Shows task count and refresh button
- **Real-time Updates**: Tasks appear immediately after creation
- **Manual Management**: Tap to edit tasks directly
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during database operations
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors with retry options

#### Bottom Half - Voice Assistant
- **Chat Interface**: Clean message bubbles for conversation
- **Input Methods**: Type or speak commands
- **Voice Controls**: Microphone button with visual feedback
- **Status Indicators**: Shows online status and processing states

### ðŸ¤– **Intelligent NLU Processing**
The app uses advanced Natural Language Understanding to:
- Parse voice commands into actionable intents
- Extract task details (title, description, due dates)
- Handle natural language date parsing ("tomorrow", "next Monday", etc.)
- Provide contextual responses and confirmations

### ðŸ›  **Manual Task Management**
- **Add Button**: Manual task creation dialog in app bar
- **Direct Editing**: Tap tasks to edit details
- **Refresh**: Manual refresh button for task list

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Split Screen Widget**: `SplitScreenHome` combines both interfaces
- **Real-time Communication**: BlocListener ensures instant updates
- **NLU Task Handler**: Processes voice commands into task operations
- **Database Integration**: SQLite for persistent storage

### Key Components
1. **Task List Section** - Upper half showing all tasks
2. **Voice Assistant Section** - Lower half for chat interaction
3. **NLU Task Handler** - Processes natural language commands
4. **Real-time State Management** - Ensures UI consistency

### Flow
1. User speaks or types a command
2. STT (Speech-to-Text) converts speech to text
3. NLU processes the command and extracts intent/entities
4. NLU Task Handler creates/modifies tasks in database
5. TaskBloc emits new state
6. UI updates instantly in both sections

## User Experience Benefits

### ðŸš€ **Efficiency**
- No need to switch between screens
- Immediate visual feedback for all actions
- Both voice and manual input available simultaneously

### ðŸ‘€ **Visibility**
- Always see current task list while adding new ones
- Real-time confirmation of voice commands
- Visual task counter shows progress

### ðŸŽ¯ **Accuracy**
- Intelligent natural language processing
- Fallback patterns for unrecognized commands
- Clear confirmation messages for all operations

### ðŸ”„ **Flexibility**
- Use voice commands for quick additions
- Manual editing for detailed modifications
- Mix both methods as needed

## Future Enhancements
- Task completion via voice commands
- Task editing through natural language
- Smart scheduling and reminders
- Task categorization and filtering
- Voice-activated task search
- Advanced date/time parsing
- Multi-language support

This split-screen approach transforms the app from a simple task manager into an intelligent, conversational productivity assistant that responds to natural language while providing immediate visual feedback.
